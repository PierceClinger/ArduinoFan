                Learning a new coding language can be very intimidating to many people. In a way, it is almost like learning a foreign language for the first time. The idea behind this simple project is to show how easy (and fun) learning how to code can be. I will be demonstrating this through a Arduino (microcontroller) and DC motor so we can see the code interact with the real world.
